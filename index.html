									<h3>Highlights</h3>
									<p>
										<ul>
										    • 1983 – Inez Bowman brought the idea of Lifeline to the attention of the community group known as the “Maryville Citizens for Community Action”.<br>
											• May 1984 – Health Emergency Lifeline Program, Inc. was officially incorporated.<br>
											• HELP formed as a not-for-profit, all-volunteer organization in the St. Francis Hospital service region.<br>
											• The program is site monitored with all units leased.<br>
											• The first 12 units were installed beginning in August 1984.<br>
											• March of 1986, the founder of Lifeline Systems, Inc., Dr. Andrew Dibner, visited Maryville.<br>
											• The Health Emergency Lifeline Program received a grant from Lifeline Systems (through the efforts of Dr. Dibner) in the amount of $4,000 for writing a “manual” entitled, “Forming an All-Volunteer Lifeline Program” which was submitted in December 1986.<br>
											• In 1987 Bob Bush, first HELP president, served on the planning committee for the Lifeline systems national conference held in Kansas City, Missouri.<br>
											• HELP has grown to as many as 181 leased units; leasing allows the program to offer the most up-to-date technology to its subscribers.<br>
											• St. Francis Hospital and Health Services provided personnel to monitor the RC500 response unit, free of charge to the program 365 days a year, 24 hours a day to 2010.<br>
											• In 2010, due to the high cost of replacing the RC500 response unit, HELP joined the Central Monitoring Program provided by Philips Lifeline.<br>
											• Beginning in 2010, HELP began a transition to purchased units while continuing to lease to subscribers. This process was completed in February 2015.<br>
											• In 2011 a transition from site monitoring at St. Francis Hospital to central monitoring from a location in Boston, Massachusetts was successfully completed.<br>
											• In 2010, after 27 years of volunteering, Donna Holt transitioned to a more limited role. In 2013/14, Nancy Baxter (28 yrs.) and Dr. Bob Bush (30 yrs.) relocated to be closer to their children. Barbara York, a retired Public Health RN and founding member, remains actively involved.<br>
											• The monthly lease cost to subscribers is reasonable and considerably less than similar programs operated throughout the United States. Installation and site monitoring are free. Only the cost of monitoring from Philips Lifeline and minimal administrative costs are included in the monthly fee. Keeping costs low is an important feature of the HELP program.<br>
											• HELP has consistently received funding from the local United Way and various service groups throughout the county to provide units to subscribers with modest means.<br>
											• HELP has been with Lifeline for over three decades of its history.<br>
											• Between 1984 and 2019, HELP has served 1,155 subscribers. Remaining in the security and comfort of their own home has been a reality for these valued members of our community.<br>
