										<h2>EMERGENCY RESPONSE AT A TOUCH OF THE BUTTON</h2>
										
									</header>
									<p><h3>
										With the touch of a button, a Lifeline subscriber is connected to central monitoring staff that assess the emergency and quickly send the appropriate assistance, 24 hours a day,7 days a week, even on holidays.  Lifeline subscribers remain at home, leading more comfortable and fulfilling lives.
										
										<br><b>AutoAlert Button Available – Includes Fall Protection</b><br>
										The AutoAlert help button worn on the outside of the subscriber’s clothing, detects a fall by the velocity of the swing of this button during the fall.  Central Monitoring, following a fall, monitors for approximately 30 seconds.  If the subscriber is not able to get up, Central Monitoring sends a call for help.  Subscribers with the AutoAlert may select to have EMTs dispatched immediately or to have a family member or other personal responder come first.

										<h2>IN-HOME EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY RESPONDERS CHOSEN BY THE SUBSCRIBER</h2>
										
									</header>
									<p><h3>
										Lifeline subscribers select normally three individuals to serve as responders in case of an emergency.  That caring support comes from neighbors, family members or friends chosen by the subscriber.
										
										<br><b>Affordable Monthly Subscriber Fee:</b><br>
										Program equipment is purchased from Philips Lifeline by HELP.  HELP leases the equipment to subscribers.  Installation and service calls are free.  The monthly lease cost to subscribers is reasonable and considerably less than similar programs operated through the United States.  Enrolled subscribers pay a reasonable monthly fee which covers the cost of Central Monitoring fees and minimal administrative costs.  Keeping costs low is an important feature of the HELP program.  Automatic bank payment is preferred.  For specific fees, see “Contact Info/Fees” elsewhere in this website.
										HELP has consistently received funding from the local United Way, Nodaway County Senior Tax Board, and various service groups throughout the county to provide units to subscribers with modest means.  HELP has also been assisted by The Gladys Rickard Trust with funds to purchase the communication units and accessories.
